# House-of-the-Dragon 龙之家族
Three basic guidelines were raised for a systematic redesignation of Arduino, ESP32, and rp2040 Rasp-Pico, etc. <i>Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion</i> were named for them, yes after Queen Danny's three dragons. These three suggestions also mention a quick connector and PCB designation layout for open hardware.

May every creative idea fly freely with wings of unified and convenient development board. And may every maker fly as a dragonraider. May the electronic  creative activities more green and sustainable for earth and human society.

## HouYi Shooting Suns  后羿射日

In the past ten years, the development board of the maker circle has been releasing new models every year, and the corresponding supporting function expansion boards are also flooding. The resulting flood of e-waste is a problem that no responsible maker can ignore. How to start from ourselves and reduce the generation of e-waste, I have three solutions. First, it uses the Wang's Connector to unify the IO interface of the expansion board. This project introduces the second solution: taking the Houyi/Hybrid layout as an example to unify several common development boards.

![后羿](https://gss0.baidu.com/-4o3dSag_xI4khGko9WTAnF6hhy/zhidao/pic/item/2e2eb9389b504fc2b1489155e8dde71190ef6d4e.jpg "后羿射日")

The birth of Arduino around 2010 promoted the innovation and creation of electronic technology in many disciplines such as art and biology, and a series of functional expansion boards followed Arduino's pin layout, although the layout itself was a serendipitous event, and some people thought it was unsatisfactory. This phenomenon shows that the layout of the development board is currently inheriting history, neither long (enough for full compliance) nor short enough (to abandon), and has not been carefully studied to effectively standardize. Especially when I designed the [Bagua keyboard](https://oshwhub.com/torah/xing-huo-ji-hua-ba-gua-jian-pan-by-sudo-wang-yq), I was particularly impressed by the non-standard of different main control boards and firmware. For example, the Raspberry Pico's USB interface and metal contacts for power input are themselves a distinctive design of the Raspberry Pi, which is convenient for flying wires to connect to external power sources or USB devices. But once it needs to be made into a keyboard, it needs to solder additional metal spring probes to maintain the connection, and the price of spring probes is still high. So I moved them to the position of the unified pin header, which is also handled on the Raspberry Pi 40pin, but not necessarily on other development boards. More importantly, when the [Bagua keyboard](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1x8411x7FG/) (the keyboard with the Bagua is listed as the matrix), I found that if I need to try other main controls, the PCB layout needs to be adjusted more, and this phenomenon is more widespread in the design of development boards for various main controls: obviously similar functions, such as realizing the control of a small RC car, or a greenhouse with controllable temperature and humidity, but because of the replacement of better performance or specific purpose chips, it is necessary to redesign the main control board, together with the redesigned expansion board. And these fixed-interface function shields are mostly idle after the tech competition. What a waste! This is a crime! To know that although the main body of the chip currently comes from the most widely distributed silicon element on the earth, how many processes, electricity, and water resources are required for the whole process from gravel to chip, and the large number of heavy metals contained in silicon-based chips also need to be recycled, and then there are also PCB boards in the manufacturing and recycling process There are also pollution and waste problems. So, if advertise yourself as a maker, at a time when environmental problems are so prominent, can you stop turning a blind eye to these old problems? Could we do better within our innovation activities, such as reducing all kinds of e-waste from the side before other green approaches such as carbon-based chips are mature?

![扩展板太多](https://github.com/Torah/House-of-the-Dragon/blob/main/too-many-shields.jpg "too many shield become elec-trash")

Based on the above considerations, I designed the [Wang's Connector](https://oshwhub.com/torah/wu-zhen-jie-kou-yi-tong-jiang-hu-xing-huo-ji-hua) at first, then took the Raspberry Pico as an example to propose the Houyi/Hybrid layout to unify several commonly-used development boards. The original Raspberry Pico layout diagram shown in Figure 1(a), the official Raspberry Pico main control board has 9 grounded GND pin pads. I don't quite know the role of redundant 9 pins, or I don't think that GND pins that need so much redundancy have any special use, especially when I need to use the main control chip of some common-used development boards, such as ESP32, 32u4, etc. also follow the similar pin layout of Raspberry Pico, I will find that ESP32 chips can use more IO pins than Pico, and even Pico fails to lead all available pins (such as 23, 25 pins) to the pin header, instead, it appears in the form of metal contacts on the back. So my suggestion is to introduce a set of design specifications (the Wang's Initiative to Standardize Board Design), as shown in Figure 1(b):
1. No more than 8 ground pins need to be shot down from the origianl position of the 9 ground pins and replaced with available IO pins;
2. Follow Pico's plate size, and retain the position of Vin, 3V3, Rst (Run);
3. The 2nd and 3rd pins from top to bottom on the right side are USB Data+ and USB Data- signal pins, respectively.

The idea to remove eight and remain one in article 1st coincided with the ancient Chinese myth of HouYi shooting the Suns, and the design specifications were to be used to modify many development boards including ESP32 and 32u4. Therefore, I named it Houyi/Hybrid board layout. Of course, as long as other chips are suitable, they will also be added to the Houyi/Hybrid board design list, and the corresponding function expansion board is expected to be compatible with multiple main control boards at the same time, thereby greatly reducing the waste of resources in the innovation process, especially the expenditure of makers' wallets. Because the number of available IO pins of the chip is different, my current recommendation is to remove eight and remain one, but leave specifically which GND open to be choosen, based on usage habits and convenience. And when the available IO pins are not enough to fill the eight positions, it is recommended that the surplus pin pads hang in the air.

## The Dragon Has Three Heads 龙有三个头

Through the above transformation, I made a [Bagua keyboard](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1se4y1n7bn/) that can be compatible with multiple main control boards, and via introducing the [Wang's Connector](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ea411V7x3/), I made the corresponding Pico expansion board. Because I first proposed the Houyi/Hybrid board layout and made the related control board, I own the naming rights to them. Daenerys Targaryen is a famous wheel breaker whose behavior is similar to that of the HouYi, or Qin Shi Huang. So I'd like to name the main control board of the ESP32, rp2040 and 32u4 chips currently redesigned with the Houyi/Hybrid layout after Queen Danny's three dragons, Drogon, Rhaegal and Viserion. And the main control board of other chips that appear later when using the Houyi/Hybrid layout can also be named by its first producer after dragons within “House of the Dragon” or “Dance of the Dragons”. Of course, considering that the footprint size of some chips is really too big to suit Houyi/Hybrid board layout, after the emergence of more suitable board design specifications for them in the future, as long as the Houyi/Hybrid plate type idea is used to unify the pin header, it can also be named after a very large dragon in the history of Westeros, such as Balerion, Vhagar, etc. Of course, if George R.R.Martin grandpa or other creators of "Ice and Fire" oppose on this, I can also name the boards after hybrid rice, hybrid fruits, etc. May every creative idea fly freely with wings of unified and convenient development board. And may every maker fly as a dragonraider.

But the transformation did not stop in this direction. In addition to my two suggestions for the Wang's Connector and the Houyi layout, I give the 3rd suggestion: the dragon has three heads.
It's not enough that the different main control boards of Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion can perfectly replace each other. In the original "Ice and Fire" prophecy that "the dragon has three heads", the dragon is a monster with three heads, exactly the same as the pattern on the Targaryen family crest. So different motherboards like Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion are expected to alternate with each other more easily.

PCB half-holes are commonly found in wireless communication modules such as Bluetooth, because half-holes have the advantage of wetting and tension for pad adsorption of solder. In recent years, it has also appeared more and more on some development boards, such as the Raspberry Pico development board. However, with the rise in chip prices in recent years, the price of modules has also risen, and the cost of modules soldered to the test base plate in the development stage is also precious. If it can be recycled, it is more environmentally friendly for the high-energy-consuming chip industry. However, the development board, including Raspberry Pico, is currently using the way of soldering pin row and function expansion base plate plugging, which will not only increase the trouble of welding pin row and female header, but also completely do not effectively use the convenience that stamp half hole may bring in, expecially when you want to recycle them and then install it on other functional boards. You need desoldering, which is time-consuming, laborious and resource-consuming. Therefore, I am inspired by the structure of fixtures such as chip burners, gives full play to the particularity of the half-hole structure of stamps, design a non-destructive connection structure, and elastically connect the half-hole PCB module represented by Raspberry Pico, so as to realize the connection and non-connection state can be reversed at any time, and the process of soldering and desoldering is not required during the state switching process, and resources and time are greatly saved.
